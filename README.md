Selenium-JAVA Automation Project
This repository contains Selenium WebDriver automation scripts written in Java.
The scripts demonstrate testing workflows on the sample e-commerce website:

I have also shared test case documentation (in Excel/PDF) alongside the scripts for better understanding.
The automation covers the following scenarios:

Login with valid and invalid credentials
Product selection process
Adding products to the cart
Placing an order
Verifying login with invalid passwords
Complete product order workflow

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for learning or practicing Selenium with Java.

Thank you!
